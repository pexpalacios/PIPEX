# PIPEX
42 Milestone 2

Pipex is about replicating bash's pipe behaviour. While the basic project only needs you to make one pipe (only two commands), the bonus asks you to manage more pipes and add a heredoc if possible.


###USAGE
```./pipex infile cmd1 cmd2 cmd3 outfile```

```./pipex here_doc delimiter cmd1 cmd2 cmd3 outfile```
